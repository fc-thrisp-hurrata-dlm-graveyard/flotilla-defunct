> Flotilla is a basic and extensible web framework for the Go language.

# Installation

Flotilla currently has 2 dependencies: [jingo](https://github.com/thrisp/jingo/) & [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter). After installing both, you can install with `go get github.com/thrisp/flotilla`.

# Quickstart


# Extensions
One of the primary goals of creating Flotilla is large pool of extensions, middleware, and packages that that promote code reuse and the wasted effort of recreating everything from nothing whenever you want to do something requiring a web framework in Go. There are no standard extensions as of right now, but examples for creating extension can be found [here](https://github.com/thrisp/flotilla_skeleton), as well your imagination in reading the Flotilla source code.
