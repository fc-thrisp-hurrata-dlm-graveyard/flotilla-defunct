# Extensions<a name="extensions"></a>

One of Flotilla's primary goals is extensibility. [Learn More](/flotilla/extensions) One of the primary goals of creating Flotilla is a pool of extensions, middleware, and packages that that promote code reuse and the prevention of wasted effort in recreating everything from net/http whenever you want to do something requiring a web framework in Go(unless thats your thing). There are no standard extensions as of right now, but examples for creating extension can be found [here](https://github.com/thrisp/flotilla_skeleton), as well your imagination in reading the Flotilla source code.
